# Bfxr

C++ port of bfxr by increpare

Library without gui and dear imgui + sdl2 gui provided

Soonish a single-header stb like library for both synth and dear imgui gui, and also possible a wxWidgets ui since file saving/loading from dear imgui might be complicated

Perhaps someday a snazzy html interface with the generator compiled with emscripten for some browser fun...

This is a work in progress
